<h2>Terminology<a class="headerlink" href="#terminology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The program operates with four geometric object types: contour, 2d grid,
surface, 3d grid. All of these objects are described in a discretized form
by a set of vertices supplied with connectivity tables.
Each object has its own unique internal name which
is used for addressing.</p>
<p>Contour is a set of points connected in a defined order with each contour
section bearing a boundary type feature. Contour can be open or closed or
even multiply-connected (bounding a multiply connected domain).
Their direction could not be set implicitly.</p>
<p>2D grid is a set of cells which are defined as a sequences of edges.
Grid cell can have arbitrary number of vertices,
the only restriction applied to a grid cell is that it can not
be multiply connected.</p>
<p>Surface is a collection of faces which are given by edges list.
As well as contours there are no restriction on the surface geometry.</p>
<p>3D grid is a set of 3D cells each of which is a closed surface.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">Not every grid format supports arbitrary cells.
Most FEM grids (like those used in GMsh) could contain
only predefined (triangular or quadrangular for 2D) cell types.
This should be taken into account during grid exporting.</p>
</div>
<p>Each grid contains its own bounding contour which is
referenced as a grid contour or grid surface.
It includes all boundary nodes of the grid along with grid boundary features.
Most procedures which take contour/surface as an invariable input parameter (e.g.
set boundary types, exclude contour from a grid etc.) could also accept
grid contours addressed by a grid internal name.</p>
<p>Boundary type is a non-geometric object which is defined
by integer positive boundary index (zero is the default value for non-defined
segments) and (optionally) a unique boundary name.
Grid exporting procedures try to use boundary names and indices
if export format supports it.</p>

<h2>Data Access<a class="headerlink" href="#data-access" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Internal structure of geometric object could not be
explicitly changed by user. However readlonly access is possible.
HybMesh <a class="reference internal" href="pyinterface.html#pyinterf"><span class="std std-ref">sctipting interface</span></a> provides a set of <em>tab</em> functions
which return vertices coordinates and different connectivity tables as
plain 1D arrays by a given table name. See documentation of

some of those tables can be access via

Note, that the latter function returns array of integers.
Hence only tables given by array of integers could be accessed.</p>
<p>An alternative way to read hybmesh geometry is to export it
to external file using supported format and parse it.
Currently export to ascii <em>VTK</em>, <em>Tecplot</em>, <em>Fluent mesh</em>, <em>GMsh</em>
formats is implemented. HybMesh also has its own

<div class="section" id="grid-superposition">
<span id="gridimp"></span><h2>Grid Superposition<a class="headerlink" href="#grid-superposition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is the basic HybMesh operation. Generally it takes two independent
grids which have non-zero domain intersection and composes them into a single grid.
The domain of resulting grid is exactly equal to the domain of geometrical union of parent grid domains and
its cells reflect the original grids cells everywhere except for a zone around the line of parent grids
contact which is triangulated providing smooth cell size transition. This zone is later referenced as a
<em>buffer zone</em>.</p>
<p>Order of superposition matters. For clarity sake we call the first of two original grids the <em>base grid</em>
and the second one &#8211; <em>overlaid grid</em>. <strong>Buffer is always built within the base grid</strong>. Cells
of <em>overlaid grid</em> are transfered to the resulting grid mostly untouched
(except for a few boundary vertices near grids intersection zone. See <a class="reference internal" href="#fixbnd"><span class="std std-ref">Fix boundary nodes</span></a> for details).
So, as you can see on the picture below, by swapping the grid roles we obtain different resulting grid geometry.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id3">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">fig. 1. Basic superposition example</span></p>
</div>
<p>Hybmesh also supports superposition of grid chain. In this regime a sequence of
superposition operations are performed over a list of grids. Each operation takes the result of previous one
as a <em>base grid</em> and use the next grid in given list as an <em>overlaid grid</em>.
You should carefully define the order of grids in a input list to get desirable result.
On a picture below you can see the superposition result depending on given grids order.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id4">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/grid_imposition2.png"><img alt="_images/grid_imposition2.png" src="_images/grid_imposition2.png" style="height: 800px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">fig. 2. Chain superposition example</span></p>
</div>
<p>Superposition with building a buffer grid only takes place if parent grid has non-zero and non single point intersection area.
Different operation results depending on relative position of input grids are presented below.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id5">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/grid_imposition3.png"><img alt="_images/grid_imposition3.png" src="_images/grid_imposition3.png" style="width: 600px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">fig3. Superposition depending on types of given grid intersections.</span></p>
</div>
<p>If grid domains have no proper intersections (two last examples on the picture above)
then the resulting grid will contain cells from both given grids assembled to a
single connectivity table.
When grids have zero intersection but a common boundary segment (second example on the
picture above) buffer will be built.
For such cases consider using of <a class="reference internal" href="#snapgrid"><span class="std std-ref">snapping</span></a> function to snap
base grid to overlaid grid contour and guarantee exact connection of grid domains.</p>
<p>Boundary features of superposed grid contour reflect boundary features of given grids.
If any boundary segment is contained in both <em>base grid</em> and <em>overlaid grid</em> then priority
will be given to features from the latter.</p>
<div class="section" id="buffer-zone-size">
<h3>Buffer zone size<a class="headerlink" href="#buffer-zone-size" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Buffer zone is constructed as an area of all <em>base grid</em> cells which contain a vertex located
no further than given buffer zone size from contact line. Larger buffer zone provides
smoother triangle grid within the buffer (see picture below).</p>
<div class="figure" id="id6">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">fig4. Superposition with different buffer sizes</span></p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to superpose grids without building triangulated buffer. This could be
done by setting zero buffer zone size.
However, if vertices of <em>base grid</em> and <em>overlaid grid</em> do not coincide at contact line superposed
grid will contain hanging nodes (see second example at picture below).
The necessity of superposing grids with zero buffer could be arisen e.g. while connecting grid to
an outer boundary grid built from its own contour.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id7">

<div class="section" id="fix-boundary-nodes">
<span id="fixbnd"></span><h3>Fix boundary nodes<a class="headerlink" href="#fix-boundary-nodes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This option defines treatment of <em>base grid</em> boundary vertices if they get into buffer zone.
Sometimes building a smooth grid within the buffer demands remeshing those boundaries. However
this can lead to change of the initial domain area and loss of some boundary features. Therefore
user is given a choice whether to allow algorithm to move such vertices or not.</p>
<p>If <em>fix boundary nodes</em> option is set to True then all boundary vertices presented in <em>base grid</em> and
<em>overlaid grid</em> will be present in the result grid if they lie on its domain boundary.
With this option is on it is guaranteed that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>overlaid grid</em> is passed to result grid without any changes</li>
<li>shape of domain intersection of input grids is precisely preserved</li>
<li>boundary features of output grid exactly replicate input grid features</li>
</ul>
<p>However there are some possible drawbacks of this option.
Picture below illustrates superposition of two square grid with complicated boundary set.
First example shows the result of operation with fixed boundary vertices.
Due to the fact that points of intersection don&#8217;t hit any of the <em>overlaid grid</em>
initial vertices two hanging nodes have appeared in the result.
Furthermore since some of boundary nodes of <em>base grid</em> lied too close to
these intersection points highly skewed triangles were built in the buffer zone.</p>
<p>Second example on the picture below shows the same operation without <em>fix boundary nodes</em> option.
In order to get smoother grid two vertices of <em>overlaid grid</em> were moved to intersection locations and
buffer zone boundary segments were remeshed. As a result we&#8217;ve completely lost blue and magenta boundary
segments but the resulting grid don&#8217;t contain any hanging nodes or highly skewed cells.</p>

<p>By default only boundary nodes which lie on a straight line (form an angle of 180 degree) could be moved when <em>fix boundary nodes</em> option
is off. This guaranties the exact preservation of domain intersection shape.
However if grids domain is formed by smooth curved lines the option <em>fix boundary nodes = False</em> will take no effect
since all points on such lines will be treated as corner points. Option <em>Zero angle approximation</em> (<img class="math" src="_images/math/e89765431934c995d7d6a5545dbd4dbf64122339.png" alt="\alpha_0"/>) allows user
to define which boundary polyline turns should be considered negligible and be treated as straight angles.
With non-zero <img class="math" src="_images/math/e89765431934c995d7d6a5545dbd4dbf64122339.png" alt="\alpha_0"/> all boundary vertices which lie within buffer zone and provide

The first was done with <img class="math" src="_images/math/5b81b2dff25a1ba7bb6062c2d2eeb7f504b0d845.png" alt="\alpha_0=0"/> hence all arc points were preserved and very coarse cell size transition occurred in the
bottom of the buffer zone. In the second example arc boundary segment of the buffer zone was remeshed to get better grid quality. However
due to loss of some shape forming nodes in the latter case result domain doesn&#8217;t exactly equal
input grid intersection domain.</p>

procedure also accepts contour and point-type constraints.
The difference is that in this case all

conditions will be located at the center of resulting grid cells.
Therefore boundary representation (but not domain area) of resulting grid

control or near the concave domain boundary vertices).
Use hybmesh <cite>heal grid</cite> routine with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">convex_cells</span></code> option to fix this.
After the grid is built some optimization procedures will be executed
in order to get rid of short edges and possible self intersections.
So the resulting grid will not be strictly of pebi type.</p>

<p>This procedure maps the domain containing a grid (<em>base domain</em>) to any other domain with equal
connectivity (<em>target domain</em>) and uses this mapping to translate the grid.
Mapping is built as a result of solution of the Laplace equation with boundary conditions of
the first kind.
Boundary values are calculated using domains boundary mapping defined by user.
Boundary value problem is solved by a finite element method using
auxiliary triangular grid built within a solution domain.</p>
<p>There are no restrictions on the input grid and target domain except for their connectivity levels
should be equal and boundary mapping for each of bounding contours should
be provided.</p>
<p>Boundary features of resulting grid could be inherited either from <em>base</em> or from <em>target</em> domain
depending on user defined option.</p>

<h3>Boundary Mapping Definition<a class="headerlink" href="#boundary-mapping-definition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Boundary mapping is defined by a collection of reference point pairs <img class="math" src="_images/math/2712d2ed56de2ddd150d8c33dd6fb6f8ceea607f.png" alt="(p_i, p'_i)"/> where

from the <em>target domain</em> contour.

<p>To obtain contour mapping user should define at least one reference point on it.
However to provide a good final result all characteristic contour points should be reflected
in the reference points collection.</p>
<p>Example of mapping of the uniform rectangle grid into a curvilinear
quadrangle is depicted in fig.1. If all four characteristic points are used for boundary mapping definition
(fig.1a) then all base contour corner points map into target contour corners and
all lateral sides of target contour have uniform partition (as it was in the base contour).</p>
<p>To obtain target boundary coarsening and refinement it is possible to define some additional
reference points on the laterals (fig.1b, fig.1c). However all such changes of boundary mapping
affect the area near the boundaries only. To get smooth internal grid with refinement towards
one of the edges base domain grid should be changed accordingly.</p>
<p>If not all corner points are defined in reference point set then this could lead to situations
when a corner point is mapped into a lateral segment.
If this happens resulting grid would have poor quality (fig.1d).</p>

<p>For example let us consider mapping of the uniform rectangle grid
into a domain with M-shaped top side (see fig.4).
Since the <em>base domain</em> is convex we can securely do it using the <em>inverse Laplace</em> method (fig.4b);
the <em>direct Laplace</em> algorithm gives improper mapping and self-intersected grid as it is
shown in fig.4a.
If we swap the roles of <em>base</em> and <em>target</em> domains, i.e. try to map
M-shaped grid into a rectangle, then, on the contrary, only the <em>direct Laplace algorithm</em>
will provide a single-valued transformation (fig.4c). The <em>inverse</em> method gives improper
mapping, i.e. some points of the <em>target domain</em> are mapped outside the <em>base domain</em>,
however, as soon as all inner base grid points have single-valued images at <em>target domain</em>,
the program is able to assemble valid, although not qualitative grid (fig.4d).</p>
<p>The proper method for grid mapping depends on a shape of input domains.
Since in practical applications <em>base domains</em> are often chosen to be smooth and regular
then the <em>inverse Laplace</em> algorithm seems to be more robust, however in some cases the <em>direct method</em>
provides better mapping near the boundaries (see examples in fig.4c, fig.5).</p>

<p>The most simple way to perform contour 1D meshing is to
define desired step and pass it along with the contour to hybmesh.
If input contour is smooth enough then equidistant meshing will be done.
Sometimes it is necessary to define some refinement to contour discretization.
This could be done by setting reference points conditions. Reference points
should lie on the contour. They act as a size function source to their left and right side
along the contour until another reference point or contour end.
These points will not be a part of resulting segmentation. Results of
contour meshing with different conditions could be seen below.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">fig. 1. Contour meshing with constant step and reference points options.</span></p>
</div>
<p>User can also define a desired number of resulting contour segments.
If that was done then for constant step method given step plays no role at all.
If reference point method was applied then refinement given through these points
will be preserved but scaled in order to match fixed segment number condition.</p>

<p>Sometimes contour contains points which must be kept in a 1D discretization.
This procedure provides four mechanisms of keeping such points:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>explicit definition of such points;</li>
<li>definition of <img class="math" src="_images/math/e89765431934c995d7d6a5545dbd4dbf64122339.png" alt="\alpha_0"/> tells program to keep all input contour vertices

So by setting <img class="math" src="_images/math/955a9b5e29143fbe500a9750490cc6abeb1a0cc0.png" alt="\alpha_0 = 0"/> algorithm will keep all original target contour vertices

all original vertices will be preserved;</li>
<li>with option <strong>keep boundary = True</strong> algorithm will not throw away original vertices

<li>along with target contour user can define a set of other contours with <strong>crosses</strong>

<p>As the previous contour meshing algorithm, matched meshing
provides routine to build 1D grid using given size function conditions.
In simple meshing method those conditions were defined on the contour and act along the contour line only.
Here conditions work in a 2D area with given <strong>influence radius</strong> and <strong>power</strong>.
As a size function source a set of standalone points
with referenced sizes or another contours could be used.
In the latter case conditional contour partition by itself is
treated as a size source.</p>
<p>To apply this method user has to define constant <strong>step size</strong>, which
will be used in areas where no conditions are acting and as a
term to define weighted size in areas under the influence of conditions.
User also defines a <strong>zero angle</strong> to tell algorithm to keep corner points.
The default value is 30 degrees.
If conditional contour intersects target contour, then intersection point
will be calculated and preserved in the resulting mesh.</p>
